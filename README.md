### 👋🏼 Hey, I'm [kovuko](https://linktr.ee/kovuko)!
I'm an 18 year old backend developer from California☀ with experience mostly in Javascript. I first started programming from [ModPE](https://github.com/topics/modpe) though most of my work from that era has been erased from this profile before archiving/private repos became a free feature. I'm currently part of the CS++ cohort from Cal State Monterey Bay doing work with [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs) and making my own applications (those are private atm).
